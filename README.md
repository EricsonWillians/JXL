#### Technical Details

JXL is a programming language that has an interpreter ([JXLInterpreter](https://github.com/EricsonWillians/JXL/blob/master/JXLInterpreter.py)) that executes code written in XML. It relies heavily on the [Document Object Model API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/org/w3c/dom/package-summary.html) of the [Java API for XML Processing](http://java.sun.com/xml). The whole code is being written in the [Python Programming Language](http://python.org/) using [Jython](http://www.jython.org/) to grant JXL the power to access the Java's libraries.
